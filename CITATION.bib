	abstract = "Symbolic learning is the logic-based approach to machine
							learning, and its mission is to provide algorithms and
							methodologies to extract logical information from data and
							express it in an interpretable way. Interval temporal logic has
							been recently proposed as a suitable tool for symbolic learning,
							specifically via the design of an interval temporal logic
							decision tree extraction algorithm. In order to improve their
							performances, interval temporal decision trees can be embedded
							into interval temporal random forests, mimicking the
							corresponding schema at the propositional level. In this article
							we consider a dataset of cough and breath sample recordings of
							volunteer subjects, labeled with their COVID-19 status,
							originally collected by the University of Cambridge. By
							interpreting such recordings as multivariate time series, we
							study the problem of their automated classification using
							interval temporal decision trees and forests. While this problem
							has been approached with the same dataset as well as with other
							datasets, in all cases, non-symbolic learning methods (usually,
							deep learning-based) have been applied to solve it; in this
							article we apply a symbolic approach, and show that it does not
							only outperform the state-of-the-art obtained with the same
							dataset, but its results are also superior to those of most
							non-symbolic techniques applied on other datasets. As an added
							bonus, thanks to the symbolic nature of our approach, we are also
							able to extract explicit knowledge to help physicians
							characterize typical COVID-positive cough and breath.",
